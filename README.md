# Roles.

This project was developed over one week during the Northcoders software development bootcamp using React.

The complete project is a Full-stack App that uses this front-end to interact with the [back-end API](https://github.com/BaiDom/be-nc-games) that I created using Node.js, PSQL and PostGres.

The app is a mock-up of a community board games review site, featuring user reviews of board games as well as voting functionality and the ability to comment on user's reviews
